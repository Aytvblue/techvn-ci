Modulation = Adding  Jan 2, 2011 Digital Modulation in Communications Systems how information is modulated onto in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signals, different types of  In general telecommunications, modulation is the process of conveying a message signal, for example a digital bit stream or an analog audio signal, inside another signal that can be physically transmitted.  The simplest type of modulation is called on-off keying, where the carrier signal is turned on to represent a 1 and turned off to represent a 0.  With digital phase modulation, the phase of the carrier wave is modified by being assigned appropriately to one bit of the information bits.  Two amplitudes are used to directly represent the data, either 0 or 1.  There are two types of modulation analog and digital.  Although there are many types of modulation, there are two basic types; analog modulation and digital modulation.  Digital Modulation Techniques.  Digital methods digitize the voice signal and use compression techniques to produce a very low-rate serial digital signal that can be modulated into a narrow band.  Digital modulation relies on digital signal processing, such as digital-to-analog converters (DACs) at a receiver and analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) at a transmitter to transform analog information (e.
